# Multimodal-Data-Analysis-Using-OpenAI

## Project Description

The 'Multimodal-Data-Analysis-Using-OpenAI' repository is designed to demonstrate the application of OpenAI models to analyze and extract insights from multimodal data, specifically text and image data. This project is ideal for those looking to leverage advanced AI models in their data analysis workflows.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Multimodal-Data-Analysis-Using-OpenAI.git
   cd Multimodal-Data-Analysis-Using-OpenAI
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- **Text Analysis:** Run `openai-text.py` to perform text-based data analysis using OpenAI's NLP models.

  ```bash
  python openai-text.py
  ```

- **Image Analysis:** Execute `openai-image.py` for image interpretation using OpenAI's computer vision capabilities.

  ```bash
  python openai-image.py
  ```

Each script provides a set of configurable options that can be adjusted to tailor the analysis to specific datasets.

## Features

- **Text Analysis:** Extracts insights from text data including sentiment analysis, summarization, and keyword extraction.
- **Image Analysis:** Supports image recognition, object detection, and content tagging.
- **OpenAI Integration:** Easy-to-use scripts that leverage cutting-edge OpenAI models for automated data analysis.
